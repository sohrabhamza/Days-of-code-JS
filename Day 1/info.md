# Problem

First day of code. Simple js form validation for name and age

The code will check if the age entered is above 17 and less than 26 for a person in college. 

Will check if name field is empty

# Tests

Try name empty

> Error: Name is empty

Try age empty

> Error: Invalid Age

Try both name and age empty

> Error: Name is empty Invalid Age

# Improvements

Could have better formatting for multiple imputs

Using regex, proper name validation can be done. (No numbers, special characters etc)
