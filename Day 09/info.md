Calendar generator using pure js, css and html.

In the html, we first make an empty table. 

Then using the date() function we can get the current date and populate the td element using a loop. 

Current date is colorized by adding a class to it.

# Tests

Open the page

> Calendar is shown with appropriate formatting

# Improvements

Could add a jump to function to jump to a certain year and month.
